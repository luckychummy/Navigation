# Project 1: Navigation

The very first project in Udacity DRL nanodegree program. The agent is suppose to pick all the yellow banana without interfering with the blue ones.

## Details of the unity agent :
		
__Unity brain name: BananaBrain__
* Number of Visual Observations (per agent): 0
* Vector Observation space type: continuous
* Vector Observation space size (per agent): 37
* Number of stacked Vector Observation: 1
* Vector Action space type: discrete
* Vector Action space size (per agent): 4

## Dependencies:

Python Environment can be set up based on the following instructions:

1. Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.6.
	* conda create --name drlnd python=3.6
	* source activate drlnd

## Instructions:

Once the environment is set, we can run the Navigation.ipynb file. model.py contains neural network class used as a Q function and file dqn_agent.py contains agent code.
The python notebook can guide us to the results.
